# 👋 Hi, I'm Pratick Kafley

I'm a Computer Science student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and user-centered software systems. My interests span backend engineering, AI-powered products, and full-stack development. Whether I’m designing a FastAPI backend, engineering a real-time eye-tracking experiment, or helping students build their first web app, I bring energy, curiosity, and an eye for detail to everything I do.
